# A Vampire Data Analysis Program for the FWPD

The Forks, Washington Police Department (FWPD) has a fancy new database technology called CSV (comma-separated values).

Your job is to parse this state-of-the-art CSV and analyze it for potential vampires.

We'll do that by filtering on each suspect's glitter index, a 0-10 prediction of the suspect's vampireness developed by some teenage girl.
